;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Languages in the Lisp family have macros, which means that some
;; Lisp forms sometimes need custom indentation.  Emacs enables this
;; via symbol properties: e.g. (put 'when 'lisp-indent-function 1)
;;
;; Unfortunately symbol properties are global to all of Emacs.  That
;; makes it impossible to have different Lisp indentation settings in
;; different buffers.  This package works around the problem by adding
;; a `lisp-indent-function' wrapper that temporarily swaps the global
;; properties for buffer-local values whenever you indent some code.
;; It then changes them back to their global values after indenting.
;;
;; The buffer-local variable `lisp-local-indent' controls indentation.
;; When a particular Lisp form is not mentioned in that variable, the
;; global indentation settings are used as a fallback.
;;
;; Enable via one or more of the following hooks:
;;
;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'lisp-local)
;; (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook       'lisp-local)
;; (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook     'lisp-local)
;; (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook    'lisp-local)
;;
;; This package does not say where your indentation settings should
;; come from.  Currently you can set them in `.dir-locals.el' or a
;; custom hook function.  In the future, more convenient ways will
;; hopefully be provided by other packages.

Causes the settings in the variable `lisp-local-indent' to take
effect for the current buffer.  The effect lasts until the buffer
is killed or the major mode is changed.

This is meant to be used from one or more of the following hooks:

    (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'lisp-local)
    (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook       'lisp-local)
    (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook     'lisp-local)
    (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook    'lisp-local)

`lisp-local' signals an error if the current major mode is not a
Lisp-like mode known to it.  It does no harm to call it more than
once.

Implementation note: `lisp-local' achieves its effect by
overriding the variable `lisp-indent-function' with its own
function wrapping the real indent function provided by the major
mode.  The wrapper overrides global indentation-related symbol
properties with their local values, then restores them back to
their global values."
